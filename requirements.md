- Framework: Django + Django REST Framework

- Database: PostgreSQL (with indexing on property_id, user_id, booking_id)

- Authentication: JWT-based, with role-based access (Guest, Host, Admin)

- Logging & Monitoring: Centralized error logging using Django signals and middleware

- Security: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit (HTTPS, AES, bcrypt)
